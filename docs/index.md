title: What is GraphQL Inspector?
---

GraphQL Inspector ouputs a list of changes between two GraphQL schemas. Every change is precisely explained and marked as breaking, non-breaking or dangerous. It helps you validate documents and fragments against a schema and even find similar or duplicated types.

> GraphQL Inspector has a **CLI** and also a **programatic API**, so you can use it however you want to and even build tools on top of it.
