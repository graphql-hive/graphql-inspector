# What is GraphQL Inspector?

GraphQL Inspector is a set of tools to help you better maintain and improve GraphQL API as well as GraphQL consumers.

GraphQL Inspector outputs a list of changes between two GraphQL schemas. Every change is precisely explained and marked
as breaking, non-breaking or dangerous. It will help you validate documents and fragments against a schema and even find
similar or duplicated types.

**Use GraphQL Inspector however you like:**

- **Command Line Tool**
- [**GitHub Application**](/docs/products/github)
- [**GitHub Action**](/docs/products/action)
- **Programmatic API**

The way GraphQL Inspector is built enables you to use everything through a CLI or each feature separately using one of
many available packages. There's also a GitHub Application that you can install and use within seconds. If you're a fan
of GitHub Actions, we got you covered too.

## GitHub Application and Action
