# Managing Pull Requests

GraphQL Inspector runs a change detection on every Pull Request. It matches the target branch with
the one defined in the Inspector configuration.

In cases of multiple environments, it iterates over all of them and compares a target branch of the
Pull Request. In single environments is less complex.

When GraphQL Inspector succeeds and finds the associated environment, it detects changes between
source and target schemas. If a Pull Request is not related to any environment, the same thing
happens.

The described approach may get you into trouble because usually, you don't want to reject Pull
Requests that are not (yet) affecting your environments.

This is why Inspector lets you still run the change detection but without rejecting those Pull
Requests. You just need to turn off the `failOnBreaking` flag.

## Single environment

You keep all the options but disable the `failOnBreaking` flag.

```yaml
diff:
  annotations: true
schema: schema.graphql
branch: master'

others:
  diff:
    failOnBreaking: false
```

## Multiple environments

You keep all the global options but disable the `failOnBreaking` flag.

```yaml
diff:
  annotations: true
schema: schema.graphql

env:
  production:
    branch: master
  preview:
    branch: develop

others:
  diff:
    failOnBreaking: false
```

## Disabling GitHub Action

It's simple, use the [fail-on-breaking](../products/action#fail-on-breaking) input.
