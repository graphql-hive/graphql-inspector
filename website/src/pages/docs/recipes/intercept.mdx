# Intercepting Schema Changes

GraphQL Inspector lets you intercept schema changes via HTTP. You're able to decide which changes
are acceptable and which are not and all of this through even a serverless function.

Whenever GraphQL Inspector runs schema checking triggered by Push or Pull Request events, your HTTP
endpoint receives a list of changes, a list of related Pull Requests or a commit SHA.

## Usage

Configuring an interceptor looks fairly similar to [`endpoints`](endpoints), except you can't modify
a method, it's always POST request.

### Single Environment Setup

```yaml
# POST with no headers
intercept: '<url>'
schema: schema.graphql

# With headers
schema: schema.graphql
intercept:
  url: '<url>'
  headers:
    auth: Basic <public-key>
```

### Multiple Environment Setup

```yaml
schema: schema.graphql
# Or globally
# intercept: <url>
env:
  production:
    branch: master
    intercept: '<url>'
  development:
    branch: develop
    intercept:
      url: '<url>'
      headers:
        auth: Basic <public-key>
```

## Setting an Interceptor Logic

Let's set all
[criticality levels to Non-Breaking](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector/blob/master/packages/core/src/diff/changes/change.ts#L67)
and GitHub Check
[conclusion to Success](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector/blob/master/packages/github/src/types.ts#L33).

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const { changes } = req.body

  res.json({
    changes: changes.map(change => ({
      ...change,
      criticality: {
        ...change.criticality,
        level: 'NON_BREAKING'
      }
    })),
    conclusion: 'success'
  })
}
```

There's so much freedom here. Because you know which commit or a pull request triggered the check,
you're able to decide if submitted changes should be rejected or accepted by fetching information
from GitHub API or your internal APIs.

## Payload and Response Structures

### Payload

Described in TypeScript. Look at the source code to see the exact shape.

```ts
import { Change } from '@graphql-inspector/core'

interface DiffInterceptorPayload {
  /**
   * https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#checkrunevent - see "pull_request"
   */
  pullRequests?: PullRequest[]
  /**
   * Commit SHA
   */
  ref?: string
  /**
   * https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector/blob/master/packages/core/src/diff/changes/change.ts#L76-L81
   */
  changes: Change[]
}
```

### Response

Described in TypeScript. Look at the source code to see the exact shape.

```ts
import { Change } from '@graphql-inspector/core'

interface DiffInterceptorResponse {
  /**
   * https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector/blob/master/packages/github/src/types.ts#L32-L36
   */
  conclusion?: CheckConclusion
  /**
   * https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector/blob/master/packages/core/src/diff/changes/change.ts#L76-L81
   */
  changes: Change[]
}
```
