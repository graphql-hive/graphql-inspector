# Annotations

GitHub offers in-code annotations and GraphQL Inspector, both App and Action enable you to use them.

It's a nice and clean way to understand what has changed, and how it looked before and after.

## Disabling Annotations

Annotations are enabled by default.

### Single Environment Setup

```yaml
diff:
  annotations: false
```

### Multiple Environment Setup

```yaml
# Per environment
env:
  production:
    branch: master
    diff:
      annotations: false

# Or globally
diff:
  annotations: false
env:
  production:
    branch: master
```
