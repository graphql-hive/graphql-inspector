# GraphQL Inspector

GraphQL Inspector is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to assist you in maintaining and
enhancing your GraphQL API, as well as the GraphQL clients consuming it.

With GraphQL Inspector, you can compare two GraphQL schemas and generate a detailed list of changes.
Each modification is labeled as breaking, non-breaking, or dangerous, with a precise explanation.
Additionally, you can validate documents and fragments against your schema, detect similar or
duplicated types, and write your own validation rules.

GraphQL Inspector offers several ways to use its features, including a Command Line Tool, GitHub
Application, GitHub Action, and Programmatic API. You can use the CLI and the programmatic API to
build your own tools on top of GraphQL Inspector, or take advantage of the GitHub Application to get
started quickly.

Use GraphQL Inspector however you like:

- Introspecting a GraphQL API and saving the introspection result to a file.
- GraphQL Inspector is a valuable tool for developers who want to maintain and enhance their GraphQL
  API. By identifying changes, validating documents, and detecting issues, it can help you ensure
  that your API is always up-to-date and working as expected.
