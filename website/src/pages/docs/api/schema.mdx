# Providing Schema

There are a few options to provide your schema in GraphQL Inspector.

## JavaScript And TypeScript File

GraphQL Inspector accepts `CommonJS` and `ESModules`

### CommonJS

```js
// Example for loading and merging multiple .graphql files into a single schema
const { makeExecutableSchema } = require('@graphql-tools/schema')
const { loadFilesSync } = require('@graphql-tools/load-files')

const typeDefs = loadFilesSync('**/*.graphql')

module.exports = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs })
```

### ESM Default Export

```ts
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema'
import { typeDefs } from './type-defs'

// as `default`
export default makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs })
```

### ESM Named Export

```ts
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema'
import { typeDefs } from './type-defs'

// as `schema` variables
export const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs })
```

If you need to transpile a file, use `--require` option of the CLI:
```
$ graphql-inspector introspect ./schema.ts --require ts-node/register
```
## GraphQL File

Files with those extensions: `.graphql`, `.graphqls` or `.gql` are supported by GraphQL Inspector.
```
$ graphql-inspector diff ./old-schema.graphql ./new-schema.gql
```
## JSON File

A JSON file with introspection results can also be provided
```
$ graphql-inspector diff ./old-schema.json ./new-schema.json
```
## GraphQL Endpoint

GraphQL Inspector can also introspect your GraphQL server:
```
$ graphql-inspector diff http://api.com/graphql ./new-schema.json
```
## Git Repository

Get GraphQL Schema file from any branch or commit of your git repository:
```
git:origin/branch:path/to/file
```
For example, you want to get `schema.graphql` from `origin/master`:
```
git:origin/master:./schema.graphql
```
## GitHub Repository

Yes, GraphQL Inspector can also do that, here's the pattern:
```
github:owner/name#ref:path/to/file
```
- `github` - Stays there, it tells Inspector we want to use GitHub.
- `owner` - Your GitHub username or organization.
- `name` - Repository's name.
- `ref` - Can be the name of a branch or commit sha.
- `path/to/file` - Where Inspector can find the GraphQL file

For example, we want to fetch a .graphql file from master branch of <span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>[this sample repository](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector-example/blob/master/schema.graphql)</span>:
```
github:kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector-example#master:./schema.graphql --token 'github-token-here'
```
<Callout type="info">
GitHub Loader requires a GitHub token to be defined
</Callout>

## Programmatic API

If you are using programmatic API, you might find `@graphql-tools/load` package useful for loading schemas. Learn more <span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>[here](https://graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-loading)</span>.
