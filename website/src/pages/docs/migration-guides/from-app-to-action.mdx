# Migrating from GraphQL Inspector App to GraphQL Inspector Action

GraphQL Inspector App is no longer available. To continue validating your GraphQL Schema against
your `master` branch, we recommend switching to the GraphQL Inspector Action. The GraphQL Inspector
Action provides similar functionality and is actively maintained.

  deprecation of the GraphQL Inspector App on GitHub
</Callout>

## Introduction

The GraphQL Inspector App was used to check your Pull Requests for breaking changes in a GraphQL
Schema. With its deprecation, you can now use the GraphQL Inspector Action to achieve the same
results.

## Migration Steps

Migrating from the GraphQL Inspector App to the GraphQL Inspector Action is a straightforward
process. Follow these steps:

1. If you've been using a `.github/graphql-inspector.yaml` configuration or `package.json`
   configuration for GraphQL Inspector and want to migrate to GitHub Actions, follow these steps.

```yaml
branch: master
schema: schema.graphql # an output of `$ graphql-inspector introspect ...`
```

It's also possible to setup everything in `package.json` (it must be placed in the root directory).

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "graphql-inspector": {
    "branch": "master",
    "schema": "schema.graphql"
  }
}
```

### 1. Create a New GitHub Action Workflow

Start by creating a new GitHub Action workflow or modifying an existing one. You can create a new
workflow file in your repository under the `.github/workflows` directory. For example, create a file
named `graphql-inspector.yml`.

### 2. Define the Workflow

Define the GitHub Action workflow with the desired events that should trigger schema checks. In this
example, we'll use a simple workflow that triggers on every push.

```yaml
name: GraphQL Inspector Check

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

This configuration sets up the workflow to trigger when there's a push event to the `main` branch.
You can customize this based on your needs.

### 3. Set Up the Workflow Job

Inside your workflow file, add a job that checks your GraphQL schema using GraphQL Inspector. You
can use the `kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector` action. Here's an example:

```yaml
jobs:
  check-schema:
    name: Check GraphQL Schema
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run GraphQL Inspector
        uses: kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector@v2
        with:
          schema: schema.graphql
          # Additional action inputs as needed
```

In this job:

- We check out the code from the repository.
- Install any dependencies you might need.
- Run the GraphQL Inspector Action, providing the `schema` path, which should point to the GraphQL
  schema file within your repository.

### 4. Commit and Push Your Workflow

Commit the changes you've made to your GitHub Action workflow file and push it to your repository.
This will trigger the GitHub Action based on the configured events (in this case, a push to the
`main` branch).

### 5. Review and Customize

Review the workflow run in your GitHub repository to ensure that it's working as expected. You can
customize the workflow further by adding more steps, setting up environment variables, or adjusting
the trigger conditions to meet your specific requirements.

With this new GitHub Action workflow, you can easily check your GraphQL schema for breaking changes
in an automated and efficient way.

### 6. Remove Previous Configuration (Optional)

Once you've verified that the GitHub Action workflow is working correctly, you can consider removing
the previous configuration files (`.github/graphql-inspector.yaml` or `package.json` configuration)
that you no longer need.

That's it! You've successfully migrated your GraphQL Inspector configuration from the previous setup
to GitHub Actions, allowing you to easily check your schema for breaking changes in an automated and
efficient manner.

## **Customize Inputs (Optional)**:

The GraphQL Inspector Action allows you to customize inputs based on your specific requirements. You
can configure options such as `name`, `annotations`, `fail-on-breaking`, `approve-label`,
`endpoint`, `rules`, and `onUsage`.

Refer to the official
[GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
for details on customizing your workflow.

## Conclusion

Migrating from the GraphQL Inspector App to the GraphQL Inspector Action is a simple and necessary
step. By following this guide, you can continue validating your GraphQL schemas effectively.

The GraphQL Inspector Action offers powerful features, including schema validation, coverage
analysis, and change detection. We recommend migrating as soon as possible to benefit from these
capabilities and ensure a smooth workflow.
