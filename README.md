**GraphQL Inspector** ouputs a list of changes between two GraphQL schemas. Every change is precisely explained and marked as breaking, non-breaking or dangerous.
It helps you validate documents and fragments against a schema and even find similar or duplicated types.

![Example](./demo.gif)

## Features

Major features:

- **Compares schemas**
- **Finds breaking or dangerous changes**
- **Validates documents against a schema**
- **Finds similar / duplicated types**
- **Schema coverage based on documents**
- **Serves a GraphQL server with faked data and GraphQL Playground**

GraphQL Inspector has a **CLI** and also a **programatic API**, so you can use it however you want to and even build tools on top of it.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add graphql-inspector
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
graphql-inspector diff     <OLD_SCHEMA> <NEW_SCHEMA>
graphql-inspector validate <DOCUMENTS>  <SCHEMA>
graphql-inspector similar  <SCHEMA>
graphql-inspector serve    <SCHEMA>
graphql-inspector coverage <DOCUMENTS>  <SCHEMA>
graphql-inspector --help
```

### Examples

```bash
# Compare schemas
$ graphql-inspector diff OLD_SCHEMA NEW_SCHEMA

Detected the following changes (4) between schemas:

üõë  Field `name` was removed from object type `Post`
‚ö†Ô∏è  Enum value `ARCHIVED` was added to enum `Status`
‚úÖ  Field `createdAt` was added to object type `Post`

Detected 1 breaking change


# Validate documents
$ graphql-inspector validate DOCUMENTS SCHEMA

Detected 1 invalid document:

üõë  ./documents/post.graphql:
  - Cannot query field createdAtSomePoint on type Post. Did you mean createdAt?


# Find similar types
$ graphql-inspector similar SCHEMA

‚úÖ Post
Best match (60%): BlogPost


# Serve faked GraphQL API with Playground
$ graphql-inspector serve SCHEMA

‚úÖ Serving the GraphQL API on http://localhost:4000/


# Check coverage
$ graphql-inspector coverage DOCUMENTS SCHEMA

Schema coverage

type Query {
  post x 1
}

type Post {
  id x 1
  title x 1
  üõë createdAt x 0
  üõë modifiedAt x 0
}

```

## Programatic Usage

```typescript
import {
  diff,
  validate,
  similar,
  coverage,
  Change,
  InvalidDocument,
  SimilarMap,
  SchemaCoverage,
} from 'graphql-inspector';

// diff
const changes: Change[] = diff(schemaA, schemaB);
// validate
const invalid: InvalidDocument[] = validate(documentsGlob, schema);
// similar
const similar: SimilarMap = similar(schema, typename, threshold);
// coverage
const schemaCoverage: SchemaCoverage = coverage(schema, documents);
// ...
```
